This repository includes the transcripts and code used in the article 'Fighting Fire with Fire: Mainstream Adoption of the Populist Political Style in the 2014 Europe Debates between Nick Clegg and Nigel Farage.' You can find a copy of the paper at http://journals.sagepub.com/eprint/KdAfFJe2u9HiWynAiEHP/full. If you can't get behind the paywall (or have questions about the project), feel free to email me at mjb@ifs.ku.dk. 

For the computational text analysis aspect of the method, I primarily used the 'qdap' package for R. 

As this was my first project using text analysis, the code is not the cleanest. However, it does work and you should be able to replicate the results in the paper by using this code.
